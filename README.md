# Possible problems & fixies

#### Database could not be read

- databasefile `db.sqlite` *and its directory* must be writable by execution program

#### Random errors on DB

- make sure you have all PHP extensions by running `composer update`

#### STMP connection error

 - if TLS is not working correctly, try set `'SMTPAuth' => false` and/or `'disable_tls' => true`

#### Local mail service at Linux/Mac

- using https://gist.github.com/raelgc/6031274 and on Linux Mint works like a charm!
- on others:
    - https://serverfault.com/questions/184138/quick-linux-mail-server-setup-for-programming
        - good to setup the aliases, so that the mail falls into your account's mailbox
        - installing procmail fixed it for me (instead of postfix)
    - easier than setting up thinderbird is just typing `mail` in commandline
